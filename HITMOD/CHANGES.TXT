version 1.5

Just a minor update this time:
  - fixed some bugs in modconv.exe, now it doesn't crash all the time and
    a few mods that didn't get converted properly are now ok.
  - added some pointers you can use in your programs to access internal
    variables of the player. Use these if you want to sync your demo to
    the music: (look in hitmod.h for more details)

         MOD_CurrentOrder, MOD_CurrentPattern and MOD_CurrentRow point
         to the current order, pattern and row being played.
          
         MOD_Volume, MOD_Freq and MOD_LastSample are arrays (one entry
         for each channel of the mod) that contain the current sample
         volume, current frequency (the amiga period value) and the last
         sample played on that channel.

  - added a '-m' switch to modconv.exe, which allows you to specify a
    minimum length for looped samples. Any looped samples which are
    shorter than this will have their looped part repeated multiple
    times until the length passes the specified minimum value. This
    doesn't help all the time, but it usually makes quite a good 
    improvement (just compare the included 4mat.mod with no -m switch
    and with -m 4000 for example). You may have to experiment with
    different minimum lengths for each individual mod to get the best
    results.

  - as usual, versions for GCC and anyone who happens to be using the
    16bit Psy-Q compiler are provided. Again the 16bit version had to
    be compiled slightly less optimised, but its probably not noticeable.
